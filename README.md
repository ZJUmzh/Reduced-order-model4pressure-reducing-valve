This is the code of paper named "Reduced-Order Modeling of Steam Flow within Pressure Reducing Valve Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition"

The calculation data of the 3D model and the symmetry are both too large. It can be downloaded at : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ULedaLHvpJKqM8coBwUvKcbxDuM-VXZi?usp=drive_link

Visualization of 3D model is relatively difficult, so the visualization part mainly focuses on the symmetry plane. The data and code corresponding to the figures in the Result and discussion are all in the symmetry folder.

Before running the code, don't forget to put the data on Google Drive in the folder. If any problems arise, please fell free to contact me at: zhehuima@zju.edu.cn.
